# Carrot Quest - Project

## Project Overview
Carrot Quest is a platform jumping game where players control a rabbit character, jumping from platform to platform while avoiding obstacles and collecting points.

## File Structure
- `CarrotQuest.html` - Main HTML structure and game screens
- `CarrotQuest.css` - Styling and animations
- `CarrotQuest.js` - Core game logic and mechanics
- `HighScore.js` - High score management system
- `data.sql` - Database schema for high scores
